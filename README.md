# SkyboxAssembler
Automation Tool to turn prepared pfm and tga files into a source friendly format.

Simply run the .ps1 file and point it to the appropriate gameinfo.txt directory, and the directory for the pfm/tga files.

The script will generate txt files for each type and pass them through vtex, where vtex will create the vtf and vmt files in the materials/skybox folder.
